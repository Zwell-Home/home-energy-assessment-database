# Contributing to Zwell Open Source Project

We welcome contributions of all forms including bug reports, code, documentation, and feedback. Your contributions help make Zwell a better project and advance our mission of fostering sustainable energy solutions.

## Reporting Issues

Your reports are valuable in improving the project. Here's how to make them effective:

- **Where to Report**: Please report issues on our GitHub Issues page.
- **Search First**: Before creating a new issue, search existing ones to avoid duplicates. Add to existing discussions if your issue is already reported.
- **Bug Reports**: A good bug report includes:
  - A concise description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Your environment details (OS, version, etc.)
  - Any other relevant information

## Contributing Changes

We appreciate code contributions. Here are some guidelines:

### DOs

- **Follow Standard Coding Conventions**: Adhere to the coding style of the project.
- **Include Tests**: For new features or fixes, include tests that cover the new functionality or the bug being fixed.
- **Focused Discussions**: Keep the discussion on the issue at hand. Open new issues for unrelated topics.
- **Claim Issues**: Before starting work, indicate that you are taking on an issue.

### DON'Ts

- **Avoid Large Surprises**: Discuss significant changes in an issue before working on a large pull request.
- **No External Code**: Don't submit code you didn't write without discussing it first.
- **No License Changes**: Don't submit PRs that change licensing files or headers.
- **Discuss New APIs**: Before adding new APIs, file an issue and discuss it with the community.

## Workflow

To contribute, follow these steps:

1. **Issue Creation**: For significant changes, create an issue to discuss the proposal. You can skip this for trivial changes.
2. **Fork and Branch**: Fork the repository and create a branch for your work (`git checkout -b my-branch`).
3. **Implement Changes**: Make your changes in your branch. Include tests and ensure your code adheres to the project's style.
4. **PR Submission**: Submit a pull request to the main branch. Link the issue your PR addresses.
5. **CI Checks**: Ensure the Continuous Integration (CI) checks pass.
6. **Review and Merge**: Wait for feedback from the project maintainers. Once approved and checks pass, your PR will be merged.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Our CI process automatically builds and tests PRs. Ensure your changes pass all checks. If the CI fails, use the provided link in the PR issue to diagnose and fix any issues.
